# Use this file to automatically forward specific artist to a given URL.
# You can use this to, for example, post new releases to a webhook that is connected to a Discord bot.
#
# Usage:
# relay_url = the target URL
# whitelisted_artist_ids = the artist IDs you are allowing to be forwarded to the target URL, separated by commas without spaces
# message_mask = the message that is sent to the target URL, where the first %s is the artist name and the second %s is a placeholder for the respective album IDs
#
# Example:
# relay_url = https://someprivatebot.com/forwarddiscovery
# whitelisted_artist_ids = 09Z51O0q4AwHl7FjUUlFKw,0cbL6CYnRqpAxf1evwUVQD,1Gh3UMZ0WVesXifHfziSx9
# message_mask = {"message":"New release from <b>%s</b>: https://open.spotify.com/album/%s"}
